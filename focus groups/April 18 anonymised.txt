[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 06:57:01
Yes. So I'll do two things. I'll activate the transcript function, which we can test.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 06:57:03
Oh, yeah. Good idea.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 06:57:04
Yeah, so it's actually working kind of okay it works. I'm also recording And we're taking these things and we're sharing it with with the other analysts. So we all get the thematic analysis. The other thing that I wanted to ask you is we do have like a survey

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 06:57:18
Yep. Great.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 06:57:27
For a follow-up that we wanted to ask them. Just before we start the games. And the reason I say before is because it asks some questions about attitudes towards AI and I don't want to I don't want the survey to be spoiled by

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 06:57:35
Okay.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 06:57:45
Primed by the conversation they had.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 06:57:47
I see. Yeah, okay, no worries. So I, before I launch into anything, I should say we're going to do a quick survey.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 06:57:54
Yeah, it should take five minutes. I'm sending it over. Yes, that's perfect.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 06:57:57
After I've done the introduction blurb. Okay. Yeah. Great.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 06:58:03
Okay, great.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 06:58:05
Let me find it. Here it is. I'm going to send a link.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 06:58:11
Over the chat.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 06:58:15
There it is.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 06:58:19
Great.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 06:58:24
Oh, here, Zach.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 06:58:26
So it takes them about 10 minutes. To do. Okay.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 06:58:29
Probably. I did it earlier and it took me like five I think… Hey, Jack, long time no see.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 06:58:35
Okay.

[Participant 3] 06:58:38
Hey, how's it going?

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 06:58:40
Hello there.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 06:58:41
Good.

[Participant 3] 06:58:43
Nice to meet you, Rachel.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 06:58:45
Good to meet you, Jack. Thanks very much for joining the focus group today.

[Participant 3] 06:58:49
Of course. Amsterdam.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 06:58:51
Where are you joining us from? Ah, very nice.

[Participant 3] 06:58:55
Well, some above it, but you know

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 06:58:58
Well, yeah, we've got great, great transport in Amsterdam, I'm sure.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 06:59:04
How's everything, Jack?

[Participant 3] 06:59:06
It's all right. End of year… deadlines to meet all the time.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 06:59:12
Tell me about it.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 06:59:20
We're just doing bit of last bits before we start the focus group. So apologies if I'm quiet just for a minute.

[Participant 3] 06:59:28
Yeah.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 06:59:29
Before people join.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 06:59:39
Okay. What's the weather like over in Amsterdam?

[Participant 3] 06:59:47
Sunny today. It's actually quite nice out. Perfect day to stay inside and work on email lists.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 06:59:50
Oh. Ideal, yeah.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 06:59:56
I'm in Scotland, so in Edinburgh, so we never get any sun.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:00:00
Oh, that's so beautiful. Oh.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:00:02
And I would love to say that it means I get lots of work done, but that's not true.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:00:06
But Scotland is one of those magical places.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:00:08
It is. Welcome, David.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:00:12
Either.

[Participant 1] 07:00:12
Hello. Hi.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:00:14
Hi. And Felix, welcome.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:00:18
And grandma, welcome. I'll just give it a few more minutes for people to enter.

[Participant 6] 07:00:24
Nope.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:00:27
Is it seven people we're expecting today?

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:00:30
Yes, we're expecting seven. But in the calendar we had confirmation from one, two, three, four, five.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:00:44
Okay.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:00:48
Oh, but one of those who didn't confirm was Jack at least here so yeah

[Participant 3] 07:00:53
Oh, okay.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:00:53
Right?

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:00:56
So sex.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:01:04
Hi, Lucas.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:01:07
Hello, welcome, I guess.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:01:13
And Tobias has joined as well. Welcome.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:01:19
Welcome, Oz.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:01:19
Hello there.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:01:25
So my guess is we're only missing Jaco. Perhaps.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:01:31
That's right.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:01:37
We'll just give him a couple more minutes.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:01:39
Yeah, I'll give them a couple of minutes because he did confirm

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:02:34
Maybe if you want to get a quick glass of water or a cup of tea or something before we start, it might be a good time.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:02:45
Are you all in Europe at the moment?

[Participant 6] 07:02:50
I'm in Australia. No.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:02:51
Oh, you're in. What's part of Australia?

[Participant 6] 07:02:55
I'm in Melbourne, right? I'm in Melbourne.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:02:58
Oh, nice. I actually did my PhD in Australia, so it hits near home Oh, my website is a mess at the moment. Please don't say that. Now I'm feeling embarrassed.

[Participant 6] 07:03:02
I know I've seen your website on uh Cool.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:03:10
I feel compelled to update it.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:03:11
Oh, that's not true. I had a look at your website as well. I thought it was very impressive.

[Participant 6] 07:03:12
Okay.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:03:15
Oh, thank you. A chain of updates.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:03:16
And I thought I should update mine, actually.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:03:22
Yeah.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:03:34
So welcome, everybody. Thank you so much for taking the time today to join this focus group. It's very helpful that you've done. So my name is Rachel Forshaw. I'm at the University of Herod Watt.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:03:53
So that's why I've jumped in as moderator today. Co-moderating with me will be Juan Pablo, who of course you've met and probably spoken to over email quite a bit.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:04:04
And I'm now supposed to explain the purpose of the session, although I think many of you know a lot about the purpose of the session.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:04:11
But what we're interested in essentially is a broader study on how researchers interacted with AI tools during the replication games.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:04:20
And what we're particularly interested in understanding is the dynamics within your team.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:04:25
So how you used or engaged with AI, if applicable, if your team used it.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:04:30
And also your overall reactions, reflections on the experience. And I want to emphasize there are absolutely no right or wrong answers. We're just here to learn from your perspective.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:04:42
And even if it's a small idea, a big idea, if it's different to what other people are saying, we want to hear it all.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:04:48
So please do feel free to use this space and time.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:04:53
A quick bit of housekeeping. I do need to let you know that we are recording the session just purely for to make it easier to transcribe. And if I can get just a verbal consent if you're happy for us to record. And of course, let me know if not.

[Participant 4] 07:05:08
Yes.

[Participant 2] 07:05:09
Yes. Mm-hmm.

[Participant 3] 07:05:09
All

[Participant 6] 07:05:09
Yes.

[Participant 5] 07:05:11
Yes.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:05:13
That's everybody. Thank you so much.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:05:18
So we're going to aim to do about 60 minutes for this session, although we may go up to 90 minutes, depending on how the discussion goes. If at any point you need a break, not a problem at all. You don't need to let us know. Just have a quick rest break and come back as soon as you're ready.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:05:35
Before we start, we also need to ask you to go through a survey which hopefully you can see In the chat. Can you see this survey monkey link?

[Participant 2] 07:05:50
No.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:05:50
No, let's reshare that.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:05:51
Let me… Yep, let me reshare that.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:05:55
Thank you.

[Participant 6] 07:05:57
Yep.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:05:58
You should think about five to 10 minutes. And… feel free to jump into it.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:06:07
As soon as you want. Yes, it is.

[Participant 3] 07:06:08
Is this the one that David created? Okay, he piloted this on me. Right, great.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:06:14
Oh, you were the test subject.

[Participant 3] 07:06:15
I've already completed

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:06:17
We have prayers.

[Participant 7] 07:06:28
Should we fill it out now, or after the the session.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:06:31
Yes, now, just now, please. I'll be doing the same.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:06:31
If you could fill it up now. Thank you.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:06:39
And if you do have any questions, please feel free to ask.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:11:19
If you can give us a quick thumbs up or any other way you want to let us know that you've finished your survey, that would be really fab.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:11:29
Thanks, Jack.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:13:52
Thanks, David. Oh, David's probably. Is that the right way of pronouncing your name?

[Participant 1] 07:14:00
That's fine. I rate the growth flees.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:14:01
Okay.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:14:11
Thanks, Roman.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:14:44
Thanks so much for joining the focus group today. My name is Rachel Forshaw. I'm co-moderating with Juan Pueblo today.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:14:50
Did we get to the verbal consent from you for being recorded?

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:14:55
Is that okay? I did already. Fabulous. Thank you so much.

[Participant 4] 07:14:57
You did get the verbal consent. That was the first one.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:15:02
He snuck in without me realising.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:15:10
Anybody need a couple more minutes or are we all okay now?

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:15:18
Think to be a sneeze it just another minute there.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:16:09
Okay, thanks so much, Tobias. Everybody's finished now, I think. I've got a thumbs up from everyone.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:16:15
So we'll get started. Thank you so much for filling in that survey. That's a great help.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:16:20
We're going to kick off with a very simple question. And I'd really like to get the opinions of everybody on this to begin with.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:16:29
Please just jump in one at a time and let me know what motivated you to participate.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:16:35
In the replication games to begin with.

[Participant 6] 07:16:45
I did other replication game with the institute of Replication. So I've already worked with the replication urbanized replication game in melbourne And so when I saw this, it's really cool We like the stuff they do.

[Participant 6] 07:17:01
And also, to be honest. Of course, shipping, I think, is very nice.

[Participant 6] 07:17:06
So that was my situation.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:17:11
Thanks, Ramad. Who wants to go next?

[Participant 4] 07:17:15
I can go next. Right, so first i also participated in a replication game in the past I thought it was fun. So why not?

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:17:17
Go ahead.

[Participant 4] 07:17:28
Second, the authorship and third my current work. I do not do much research.

[Participant 4] 07:17:36
So I concluded my phd about a year ago and I work at the World Bank.

[Participant 4] 07:17:42
So I do some Sometimes I do research, sometimes I don't.

[Participant 4] 07:17:47
So it was a good way to do some coding which doesn't happen so I like.

[Participant 4] 07:17:55
I was also interested in the experiment itself i find it cool it's something that i might chat with people right it's right it's a it's a very… important topic nowadays.

[Participant 4] 07:18:11
I think.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:18:12
Great. So a couple have already said co-authorship. Any other motivations?

[Participant 4] 07:18:21
Okay.

[Participant 7] 07:18:36
On replication files. So, and with the hop of Ai.

[Participant 7] 07:18:39
So disposal. Basically, the research question uh. Made me think. Oh, I probably should join this group or this. This research project.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:18:49
Thank you. Who wants to go next?

[Participant 2] 07:18:52
I also found the challenge of replicating other people's data quite fascinating.

[Participant 2] 07:18:58
At that time, I did my PhD in data science related task within the field of psychology.

[Participant 2] 07:19:05
And I was like, wow, well, I'm always focusing just on my structural equation modeling and all that stuff.

[Participant 2] 07:19:12
What else is there out there? And on my statistics skills up to the level that you find another paper. So I was hopefully rooting to have to put my own hand on the coding and not let AI do everything for me.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:19:30
And I think Lucas wanted to jump in next.

[Participant 5] 07:19:34
Yeah, so I started my PhD, I think like two years ago and directly with a meta science topic And therefore, it was quite natural to take part in a replication game at some point. So this was my first replication game

[Participant 5] 07:19:53
And my supervisor told me about the replication games and uh how much fun it was and yeah and Then also the experiment itself and because also like six months ago i I began to include So

[Participant 5] 07:20:20
Ai in my daily work life and therefore was quite interested in how this could help to reproduce scientific results.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:20:32
Thank you. Who would like to go next, Jack or David?

[Participant 3] 07:20:44
I came maybe to add something additional. I, uh. I also was interested in the mechanics of how this would work. So I've tried to working with Or I had prior to this tried working with LLMs in order to Trying to make my life easier in research and often was frustrated with the output so i was hoping

[Participant 3] 07:21:04
That by participating, I could also see like a better way of doing it. Maybe there was something that IFRR had already figured out about how to use the software a bit better.

[Participant 3] 07:21:14
In order to maybe make my life easier in research.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:21:17
So when you say mechanics, you mean the mechanics of how to use AI or about the the experiment itself.

[Participant 3] 07:21:25
Yeah, so maybe i think i think a little bit of both. So I was interested in what it would mean for AI to lead your research in some sense, like what it would look like You know, to actually implement AI and then also the access to

[Participant 3] 07:21:41
The specific AI software that we were using, some of which was proprietary and not available to people with free accounts at the time. So just seeing, you know, would that work better? And then were there specific prompts that were already ready? Of course, it turned out we actually had to make those up on our own. So I guess that

[Participant 3] 07:21:59
Particular purpose of joining up wasn't fulfilled but That was part of the motivation as well.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:22:04
Great, thank you. And David, finally. Team.

[Participant 1] 07:22:09
Yeah, so… most of my motivations were covered by previous speakers but um I think that what the Avelle and all other contributors to the Institute of Replication doing is fantastic and it's Generally, calls were supporting whatever the precise games or event is about.

[Participant 1] 07:22:37
And I also participated in a previous edition of Replication Games that was in person. And that was a very nice networking event that led to collaborations outside of the outside outside of the replication game so that is something that uh

[Participant 1] 07:22:55
Like very much now this AI games are very short so and only virtual so that didn't lead to Another application, but there was no motivation for me to.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:23:06
That's great. Thank you all for your thoughts there. Now, my next question was about your experience in replication before, but actually a lot of you have mentioned a lot of experience in replication before.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:23:21
I think everyone has done at least one games is that Correct. Anybody that didn't have any experience with replication before or reproducibility?

[Participant 5] 07:23:32
Before the AI games? I had no experience with replication games.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:23:34
Yes.

[Participant 5] 07:23:40
But in my master's studies, I replicated some papers as a term paper.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:23:45
Okay.

[Participant 5] 07:23:46
And also in my master thesis replicated difference in different studies with a staggered implementation.

[Participant 5] 07:23:55
With the new estimators so I had some experience with replications before, but not with replication games.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:24:00
As part of your research. Thank you. And before part

[Participant 7] 07:24:03
Like the same for me like it was my first replication game.

[Participant 2] 07:24:03
For me, then…

[Participant 7] 07:24:07
So the first verification game. With the Institute I participated in, but I have some experience in replicating and producing replication files for.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:24:18
I see.

[Participant 2] 07:24:20
I didn't ever had any prior experiences with replicating other people's science beforehand before these replication games.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:24:31
Thank you very much. So before participating in these replication games, what were your expectations about the role AI might play in your team's work

[Participant 4] 07:24:54
You mean before I knew that I wasn't in an AI team because I was in a UN team.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:25:01
It matters, yes, what kind of team you're in. So if you're in a human team so No expectation. Yeah, that makes sense.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:25:01
Yes.

[Participant 4] 07:25:05
Once I knew that I was in a human team, of course, I had no expectation whatsoever.

[Participant 6] 07:25:12
So for me, I was in the machine team and my petition was I didn't really understood like the the treatment because i wasn't The treatment was, okay, AI will do everything. And at the time, I didn't have much experience with like

[Participant 6] 07:25:31
Chatgpt and AI, but… My view coming into this is that this has zero chance.

[Participant 6] 07:25:38
Of working i can understand working along the ai That makes sense to me.

[Participant 6] 07:25:44
Where like AI is like some sort of assistant or when I work with a student i'm checking the work they do, but just letting I do everything i was like Okay, we'll try, but this is not going to work. That was my expectation.

[Participant 6] 07:25:59
Coming to into this and coming into this and before like the results etc my my expectation will be the cyborg team will do very well and the human will be aware and the matching team will be a disaster that was

[Participant 6] 07:26:15
What I saw.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:26:16
Where does that expectation come from, this idea that it's not going to work?

[Participant 6] 07:26:24
And this was also my, so that was my expectation but that's also my experience at the end when we did the game It's just too much to ask too much to ask to chat gpt i mean so for me chat gpt you know you give him the paper and ask a summary and then

[Participant 6] 07:26:42
You get a summary which might be correct might be incorrect Let's feed him and i've done replication before it's not easy right so feed him a lot of code a lot of data and and let him find which cool. So I just thought it was too ambitious

[Participant 6] 07:26:59
Phone ai to do on its own. Had very little experience of i had experience with AI, but not So in a way in a way the game told me some things that can be done with AI that I didn't know

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:27:00
So it's based on your previous experience using AI.

[Participant 6] 07:27:16
But I've never feeded so much usually you will do like very small things with ai and not like sending me like 10 files and sending them files asking to find something in there.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:27:32
What other, so go ahead.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:27:33
Let me ask you a question. Do you think that would still be the case?

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:27:39
If the games would be today like you would still have the same underlying feeling that it's too much to us.

[Participant 6] 07:27:45
So I think it's much better for two reasons. So first, I'm much better at AI a year later. And I feel also ChatGP is much better now. So when I say AI, I'm just talking about strategy.

[Participant 6] 07:27:56
What i know i think it's much better so i think if we had to read it today, the machine will do better, but I think this tool will not do well and I was still saying like the cyborg team will do much better

[Participant 6] 07:28:10
But I think now both unbearous, I think I will ask better question to ChatGP.

[Participant 6] 07:28:16
And I feel like chatbt is I mean, every time I ask something i'm more and more impressed, right? So I think it's better now.

[Participant 6] 07:28:25
I guess.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:28:25
Thank you. How are other people's expectations of what might happen with the AI?

[Participant 3] 07:28:32
Mine were also quite poor, but they came from a different source. One was just personal. I've done a lot of really complex replications where you had to really in-depth know the the features of the paper in order to understand it quite well, things that I don't think that an LLM would pick up on.

[Participant 3] 07:28:49
But another reason is just because of what LLMs are sort of designed to do.

[Participant 3] 07:28:55
Which, you know, even for paid users, you've already given the money So the idea is basically keep them subscribed to the platform while minimizing costs.

[Participant 3] 07:29:05
And if you hand an LLM a really complex task and there's sort of a way to hallucinate the task in a way that will seem satisfactory to the end user While simultaneously doing as little runtime on your own server's end, you minimize your costs.

[Participant 3] 07:29:21
So I actually think that there is some good reason to believe that a lot of the outputs that were fed to the machine team units, part of the reason why the machine team performed so poorly is because the LLM was just hallucinating as a structural function of like what it's designed to do, which is

[Participant 3] 07:29:36
To minimize runtime costs.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:29:41
Thank you so much. I like this discussion of tasks in particular about what you'd expect it to be good and bad at.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:29:49
Any other thoughts there about what you expected, in particular the tasks that AI would be good or bad at?

[Participant 7] 07:29:56
Um. I was expecting that the differences in terms of the programming language would be very diverse, so I expected stata to be kind of like the poorest, and then R. And python be.

[Participant 7] 07:30:09
Or touch gbt or llms would be much better in with respect to those programming languages so. This was.

[Participant 7] 07:30:15
One of my expectations. Which is probably also based on my.

[Participant 7] 07:30:22
Experience. So I think, with stata chat gbt is like. Um.

[Participant 7] 07:30:26
Yeah, um has more trouble than with with other programming languages.

[Participant 7] 07:30:32
For the ones we used are, and and python. I don't know about any yeah.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:30:36
So you'd previously used these coding languages

[Participant 7] 07:30:38
Just if you say, Okay, I need like the command for for something, and then for stata.

[Participant 7] 07:30:46
It didn't work, but for python it generally works well, if you don't know one specific command, and you just went out. Okay, how do you extract whatever or.

[Participant 7] 07:30:55
The program in your loop, or whatever done with Python. With my own experience. It works.

[Participant 7] 07:31:00
Or it has worked better. So that's why I expected.

[Participant 7] 07:31:04
That the replication packages in R and Python would be much like the.

[Participant 7] 07:31:09
The success rate of the replication would be much better by solely using llm.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:31:15
And this was from your experience prior to the games Or is this a reflection since?

[Participant 7] 07:31:19
Yes, yes, yes, a bit. Yeah. Yeah?

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:31:23
Okay. Thank you. Who else would like to jump in on this question? Go ahead, Felix.

[Participant 2] 07:31:30
So I expected ChatGPT to be very good in identifying in the paper what we are supposed to be doing in terms of the maths behind everything, the statistical methods. So summarizing the text document, I expect it to be quite strong and

[Participant 2] 07:31:51
And maybe also finding elegant or more elegant coat for this stuff than i personally do Yeah, those were my two expectations, which were not met funnily enough, because it kind of summarized it and left out some crucial details

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:32:12
Do you want to expand on that, on how your expectations differed from the reality.

[Participant 2] 07:32:18
Well, yeah, I expected. It to be bottlenecked basically by my ability to put ChatGPT into the right direction.

[Participant 2] 07:32:29
I still thought that I have to think And then ask ChatGPT to do what I want it to do.

[Participant 2] 07:32:37
But also, yeah, but also I expected ChatGPT to be very strong in summarizing information without any missing aspects.

[Participant 2] 07:32:49
But yeah, it did miss out on some crucial aspects. And funnily enough, it came up with some more creative ideas than I have. So it was kind of reverse my expectations and came up with some great code, but it came also up with some ideas on what else to try if things don't turn out as I hoped it.

[Participant 2] 07:33:10
Good. Yeah, so for example So I asked Hacha Petit, what have the researchers been doing there what was based on the paper. In fact, I didn't feed the R script into the LLM. That was my mistake.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:33:11
Do you want to expand on those creative ideas?

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 07:33:11
Could you explain?

[Participant 2] 07:33:28
So it didn't look into the cult what they've done. I just asked it based on the paper.

[Participant 2] 07:33:34
And I asked it, what did the researchers do? And then it told me that these five aspects. They missed out on some corrections, I think they use or something. Not fully sure what I remember. Anyway.

[Participant 2] 07:33:49
And I said, please replicate those things so first step do this then do that, then do that, then that. Then these five steps and generate a graph out of it. And the table didn't match the results. And I said, well, this is very unfortunate.

[Participant 2] 07:34:08
What may be the cause of this deviation. And I have my own thoughts. I was on the cyborg team about it. And it came up with a broader variety of potential reasons why the table didn't match with the aim that I wanted to, the goal that I imagined.

[Participant 2] 07:34:28
Yes. And yeah, it still didn't solve anything. It only solved stuff when I've fed it with the actual R script in the end and it came to the right conclusions But it came up with a broader knowledge base basically on potential reasons why the math didn't math out.

[Participant 2] 07:34:50
In the end.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:34:50
Thank you. Lucas or David, I don't think I've heard from you on this question. Do you want to jump in at all?

[Participant 5] 07:34:58
Yeah, my expectations or my fear was to be in an AI-led team And I was also sorted in the AI led team I wasn't really expecting that AI could be on its own really reproduce a whole paper or the main claims of the paper.

[Participant 5] 07:35:19
And I was also quite impressed because I think that was a new feature back then the data analyst of chat gpt that it really runs its own code and you can use data.

[Participant 5] 07:35:35
But I was also skeptical that then works with if the paper is a replication package provides data code that the This can then be translated into Python code and then be actually run in ChatGPT or that chat gpt runs

[Participant 5] 07:35:55
It in Python code and reproduces the results.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:36:00
Thanks, David. Anything to add there?

[Participant 1] 07:36:05
I'm sure if I have anything to add and not even quite sure what were my expectations very precisely. I have to admit it's been a while.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:36:13
That's okay.

[Participant 1] 07:36:13
Though I also don't think I expected very much from from ChatGPT to add ever since the cyborg I was quite happy about that so that I wouldn't have to figure out all these pointing chat gpt towards what you do.

[Participant 1] 07:36:32
But based on my previous use of ChatGPT in trying to understand the published research, it has been quite hit and miss. Sometimes it manages and it's really helpful and sometimes it just goes completely off and comes up with something that looks like a solution but it's not so

[Participant 1] 07:36:52
Yeah, I didn't expect much but i mean it was just a few hours of fun and

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:36:59
Thank you. Okay, so this one is for this question, next question is for people that I were on the cyborg or machine teams. So apologies, Jaco.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:37:12
You're welcome to contribute, although it may not be so relevant.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:37:15
But can you describe how your team used ChatGPT during the games?

[Participant 6] 07:37:26
Okay, so I was in the… In the machine team, just coming back to what people said that was I think everybody on our team was a bit unhappy to be on the matching team we all Because we also studying it very pessimistic saying okay this is not going to work

[Participant 6] 07:37:46
And we did the very first, I was in the very first uh game so maybe things changed after. I'm not sure if it was a pilot or something like that.

[Participant 6] 07:37:54
And where we start us is at the start stuff that cannot be run by ChatGPT. And I see that some people translate it in r and and then run it this way we didn't do that.

[Participant 6] 07:38:07
We ask ChatGPT for the line of code and then we run it on our own machine to have it.

[Participant 6] 07:38:15
And from the start i will really struggle because in the papers okay you need to go to table two extract from that table that number And Chadipreet could not do it.

[Participant 6] 07:38:29
So at the end we had to open the paper off read the line and say okay this is what you need to replicate finding the code and then you find it I mean, I'm not sure I'm really answering the question anymore, but my experience is that

[Participant 6] 07:38:47
Once we told what we were looking for.

[Participant 6] 07:38:52
We're picking things out and finding in the good way where it was was very fast.

[Participant 6] 07:38:58
And after that, we could not do much because we then we'd look for errors and like there was no way to find it.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:39:08
Yeah.

[Participant 6] 07:39:08
The difficulty was to match the code with the actual paper.

[Participant 6] 07:39:13
And as a human, I can do that very easily. But we could not make ChatGPT match what the code was and what the paper was doing so

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:39:13
I see.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:39:23
And when you say that you're asking ChatGPT for the line of code.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:39:29
So you were literally saying to it, I want you to print out to screen Line, nine.

[Participant 6] 07:39:33
Yeah, so I was saying, okay, I need to reproduce Tableau.

[Participant 6] 07:39:40
Row two colon five and that's a regression And I have a du file so the startup file where there's a line of code there I'm going to copy past it and put in my start and just press enter.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:39:41
Yeah.

[Participant 6] 07:39:56
Because the instruction we got is like you should talk to ChatGPT and not do things myself so i was just trying to just copy past whatever ChatGP is giving me put that in instead of present to them.

[Participant 6] 07:40:10
So put as little input as possible from myself.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:40:14
But you tried that strategy after. I assume asking um chat GPT to run it, but unsuccessfully. Is that correct?

[Participant 6] 07:40:21
No, I do think we tried. I don't think we… we didn't even thought it was possible and and i didn't we didn't saw all translate in python and run it that didn't come to my mind. And now someone said it, that's like, yeah, we should have done that. But yeah, we…

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:40:23
You didn't try it that way.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:40:34
The code was in R.

[Participant 6] 07:40:38
We didn't think about it.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:40:41
Okay. I think you're the only one that had a machine only team. Is that correct? Or is anybody else's machine?

[Participant 3] 07:40:48
I was on machine learning as well.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:40:50
You were as well. Can you talk about your, did you have similar different experiences

[Participant 3] 07:40:55
Our experience was just all around awful. So it's not just data and it's not just because it was early. We were late and we were on R and everything else was terrible. We walked in.

[Participant 3] 07:41:06
I think I was pessimistic, but my team members were a bit more optimistic that they could get it to work.

[Participant 3] 07:41:17
And basically, we spent a long time trying to get code that would do basically anything to work. So in our case, we were trying to reproduce a figure.

[Participant 3] 07:41:29
And that figure just uh when you could see it, you could see it after… the games ended that it's basically like a grid of bar plots effectively.

[Participant 3] 07:41:44
And those bar plots Where sometimes they were just white squares. Sometimes there were the right number of squares, but there were no bars in the plot.

[Participant 3] 07:41:55
The graph never gave us anything useful at any given point.

[Participant 3] 07:41:59
And we spent hours just trying to make it work. Then we tried switching over to Python thinking, okay, it's object oriented. It might do something similar in Python.

[Participant 3] 07:42:08
And actually, I think that was what we ended up doing. I think that the end solution was we ended up using Python instead of the original R code.

[Participant 3] 07:42:17
Which means that for whatever it produced, it wasn't doing it using the programming language that we were actually using. We had to give it something that it seemed to understand a bit better.

[Participant 3] 07:42:27
But even that didn't reproduce. It didn't even get anywhere close.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:42:31
When you said that you switched to Python, did you ask chat gpt to convert it to Python or did you yourselves convert it to Python?

[Participant 3] 07:42:32
Uh…

[Participant 3] 07:42:39
We asked ChatGPT to convert it to Python. So we actually, we ended up opening a new terminal. And this goes back to what I was saying earlier about what ChatGPT is designed to do, which is about getting people to get off the software as soon as possible to minimize its load.

[Participant 3] 07:42:55
At some point we got requests that were so unhelpful that we had to go to a new terminal In order to get results that weren't washed out by our old questions that we were asking ChatGPT to do. And it was in this newer terminal

[Participant 3] 07:43:08
That we asked it to start converting the R code over to Python.

[Participant 3] 07:43:13
That actually went relatively smoothly, at least getting code that looked like okay like a number of us had a decent Python proficiency, we could look at it and say, okay, this is roughly similar to what you would doing the R code.

[Participant 3] 07:43:27
And ChatGPT was the one that was reproducing that, yes.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:43:30
Okay, thank you. Okay, so we… Yep.

[Participant 5] 07:43:33
I also was in a machine team And it wasn't as frustrating as check.

[Participant 5] 07:43:44
X group experienced it because Yeah, I don't know the replication package was pretty much running as we As we asked ChatGPT what to do.

[Participant 5] 07:43:57
To run it on our own computers but we were basically at a dead end when there was a thing that we had to download the raw data files So the README was, I think, I had two options that we download raw data files on our own

[Participant 5] 07:44:21
Or we skip the pre-processing do file So the cleaning part And we took quite some time try to figure out with chat gpt or let ChatGPT figure out which files on the websites we actually have to download and what to do.

[Participant 5] 07:44:43
And that didn't really work out. And then we asked Eric if we could choose the second option.

[Participant 5] 07:44:50
And then we were basically more or less good in reproducing the results in the original paper.

[Participant 5] 07:44:58
But of course, that's a huge disadvantage that we did not really do the preprocessing part And then I think, yeah.

[Participant 5] 07:45:10
It was pretty smooth. Because it was a bit frustrating always because it was always you basically know the error, this data error, and know what to do and then you still have to ask ChatGPT quite Often, if you then run always in the same

[Participant 5] 07:45:29
Error again and then again After some time.

[Participant 5] 07:45:33
It worked and yeah That's basically all I have to say.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:45:38
Thank you. Those of you on the cyborg.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:45:44
Did your experiences similar differ?

[Participant 2] 07:45:52
I'll just start. So I think we have massively underutilized ChatGPT.

[Participant 2] 07:45:58
Because as I said. We didn't upload all the data to ChatGPT, just the paper at the start.

[Participant 2] 07:46:06
And missed out big times on the benefits of ChatGPT seeing the actual code that has been used.

[Participant 2] 07:46:15
Yeah, at the start, we just try to use it to understand what has been done.

[Participant 2] 07:46:22
To aid our own thinking process. So we didn't ask ChatGPT to do this stuff for us.

[Participant 2] 07:46:27
But rather we said. Please aid us doing our own thing.

[Participant 2] 07:46:32
Now, the issue with our team was also we were just two people And one person, we were in the stator group, but one person never touched Stata.

[Participant 2] 07:46:41
And wasn't really didn't handle statistics at all. So we were basically both of us separately working one-on-one with ChatGPT, which was a little bit sad.

[Participant 2] 07:46:55
But she tried to basically replicate the R file in Python and rewrite everything by herself or with the aid of chat gpt to less success than she hoped for.

[Participant 2] 07:47:09
I found myself also limited my own you know Yeah, myself, big times because I was bottlenecking the process by just asking ChatGPT to help me write nicer code basically And yeah, I think yeah Once we really utilize ChatGPT in the end.

[Participant 2] 07:47:34
By uploading more data to it, by asking it what exactly has happened based on the code as well.

[Participant 2] 07:47:42
And what are the potential reasons why the code doesn't come out as we hope all the the tables then uh we made quite quick progress, I would say.

[Participant 2] 07:47:53
But before, we didn't provide all the information It was a rather frustrating endeavor.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:48:00
So how did you modify your interactions with ChatGPT as you went along?

[Participant 2] 07:48:06
Yes. So a good question. So at the start, we literally only attached the one PDF of the paper.

[Participant 2] 07:48:14
And later we modified it by uploading the other data as well.

[Participant 2] 07:48:19
And I think that made the the most change created the greatest change. Other than that.

[Participant 2] 07:48:28
I think we often started new chats starting from anew, basically.

[Participant 2] 07:48:35
So we didn't keep the whole context. For a fresh start basically because we used it for singular tasks.

[Participant 2] 07:48:46
Help me do this. Help me do that step. Help me do these things and not giving providing the whole context and then just telling chat gpt come up with a nice solution that incorporates all the context factors.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:49:03
I'm going to circle back to this idea of how people modified over time, but I just did want to give Dad Observin a quick chance to jump in here if there's anything you want to say on this.

[Participant 2] 07:49:06
Yeah.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:49:15
Topic.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:49:19
Of just how you used ChatGPT during the games.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:49:27
Sorry, no, David, you're a cyborg, correct?

[Participant 1] 07:49:33
Um… So again, as far as I remember.

[Participant 1] 07:49:39
I was also in a two-person team and my colleague was also not that well versed with running empirics in Interestingly. So nonetheless, we tried. I mean, for the first three hours or so we had like six right we just try to

[Participant 7] 07:49:40
Actually, I contribute to this question.

[Participant 1] 07:49:59
Do the human-only approach. Which included the robustness checks and the replication which That's fair enough. You can just do that. And I really wanted to understand what's happening.

[Participant 1] 07:50:11
And only after we really didn't manage to find anything off as the good, apart from that it was quite messy. I think we wrote that in the in the feedback file that for at least for the paper we were assigned

[Participant 1] 07:50:25
It ran, but it was really, wow, that was so a lot of lines for in the end, one OLS request So then we tried to use ChatGPT and said, well.

[Participant 1] 07:50:39
But we have to admit we were guided by the fact that We assumed there must have been something wrong because that was kind of the task right or at least that's how we understood the task find the error And we just didn't find that i read around and

[Participant 1] 07:50:54
Well, there's the result. So I tried to check the chat, actually. I still have the link but it's been removed it seems so i can't look it up anymore. So from best of my memory.

[Participant 1] 07:51:09
We did upload the do file or we just copied at least the relevant parts into the chat and said look here's the code, here's the code.

[Participant 1] 07:51:20
Are there any issues? And then ChatGPT just started coming up with issues and then we had to read what you know what all these things that it comes up with and And… And we didn't agree. It was mostly just coming up with, there's a problem here, but then we read it and there was no problem to our understanding so

[Participant 1] 07:51:42
That's how we use chat GPT. So we really just use it as if there had been a third person in the room talking to us and reading the code together. So we didn't upload the data we didn't read actually no it doesn't upload the data but

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:51:43
I see.

[Participant 1] 07:51:56
But that didn't work quite well. So in the end, we ended up just discussing the code and running it on our own machine.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:52:05
Okay, and circling back to that question of how did your interactions of ChatGPT change throughout the question and apologies to both Tobias and Jacapon.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:52:16
Being the human arm here we will circle back to you shortly.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:52:20
But yes, how did it change over the session?

[Participant 1] 07:52:29
There wasn't really much change in my team because we really started using ChatGPT only after we have essentially exhausted all our human human things and then So I can't really comment on that sorry we just started using ChatGPT after

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:52:46
That's okay.

[Participant 1] 07:52:50
I spend enough time to

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:52:58
Anyone else?

[Participant 6] 07:53:01
Well, I think I'm just going to repeat a bit what I said before, but for us vaping was very frustrating because we could not get anywhere and we truly try Our restriction was do not open the paper And so at the beginning, we could not even get

[Participant 6] 07:53:17
What is what are we supposed to to reproduce because that was like a sticky comment on the pdf So that was okay i think we we talked with adam and saying we do need to open we do need to have some human intervention here

[Participant 6] 07:53:35
And so then we open the stuff, we read a little bit the paper and we find what we're supposed to reproduce And then it was super fast we find what was the line of code we should run to reproduce that number. So we reproduce that number super fast.

[Participant 6] 07:53:50
So that was very good. That was like a very nice interaction with chat gpt And then after it was hours of nothing. Just where's your blah blah just talking chat gpt trying to find an error and not getting anywhere it's and then i when the and then we just gave up and that's it

[Participant 6] 07:54:12
And the day after we got an email saying what was the error and we were not even remotely close to that zero in the paper. So we could have done this for 10 more hours, we will not fund the error. No way.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:54:25
I see.

[Participant 6] 07:54:27
So yeah.

[Participant 5] 07:54:30
Yeah, also… I was, again, in the machine and also so the reproduction was also rather clean but also finding errors or asking ChatGPT about errors it always replies that there's no error at all and the day after I talked to person

[Participant 5] 07:54:54
Was in the human team and they had the same paper and the The errors were pretty obvious and quite dramatic and also change the main claims of the paper And yeah, this was quite shocking because ChatGPT no… no real grasp of some obvious errors like the

[Participant 5] 07:55:21
This thing in stator that data missing values are basically equal infinity and that Is that then?

[Participant 5] 07:55:32
Recode it and if you recode in recoded as a dummy variable you recode missions as a one, for example.

[Participant 5] 07:55:40
Depending on the condition. And this was an obvious problem And yeah, this was quite shocking afterwards.

[Participant 5] 07:55:48
And yeah. Yeah, that's like simple errors and also we asked ChatGPT if everything aligns with the paper like the regression commands, if those options align with the the things the authors report in the paper.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:55:49
How do you mean shocking?

[Participant 5] 07:56:10
What they do. And this was not the case as i was As my colleague told me as my colleague told me afterwards and this was afterwards shocking to me because not really shocking but um yeah was um increasing my doubt in ChatGPT. If I now ask ChatGPT about my code, if there are any obvious errors, I cannot really trust it anymore.

[Participant 5] 07:56:35
Or I have to specifically ask about single lines of code and rather ask ChatGPT to explain it to me then um some general question if there is something wrong with it.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:56:35
Understood.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:56:50
So overall, and this is my last bit of question on AI before we talk about something that the human teams can chime in on.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:56:59
Overall, how would you feel about how it affected your team's performance using AI?

[Participant 6] 07:57:10
For us, it'd make us way worse if i was in human or cyber team i would have done a much much better job.

[Participant 6] 07:57:20
I think if I was, I might not find the error and also it would have been nice Because Chad talking to chat GPT and going nowhere for three hours is not that fun.

[Participant 6] 07:57:33
So, yeah.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:57:35
Any other experiences there?

[Participant 3] 07:57:37
In our case, we had a paper that was an APSR, which if I remember correctly, has a data editor.

[Participant 5] 07:57:38
Yes.

[Participant 3] 07:57:43
And so the package there should reproduce in one button click.

[Participant 3] 07:57:46
So you change one directory pathway, you click one button and everything should reproduce.

[Participant 3] 07:57:52
A lot of packages work that way where they're clean reproductions and then maybe as you replicate, you find, oh, the code doesn't line up with what the paper's saying, but the paper on its own is reproducing just fine.

[Participant 3] 07:58:03
And just doing that first step, something that should be push button goes from a task that should take minutes into a task that takes hours.

[Participant 3] 07:58:11
Hours upon hours of frustrating going back and forth with the software. So even just getting past the first hurdle, the step zero of reproducing the paper just made it take so much longer to do.

[Participant 5] 07:58:27
Yeah, I also think we would have performed way better as humans or cyborgs we probably would have been able if we read the paper or the README file in detail to download all the raw data files and also to do the data cleaning part.

[Participant 5] 07:58:48
Which uh should be done in a proper reproduction.

[Participant 5] 07:58:57
And also the errors, of course, finding the errors in the two files would have been much easier if we could look at code with our own eyes basically.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:59:11
So what I'm hearing is lots of kind of frustrating simple tasks that the AI struggled to do. Was there any positives at all

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:59:30
Go ahead, Felix.

[Participant 6] 07:59:30
So from what I remember, from what I remember, at some point it was very fast so Once we set things up, finding the correct line of code because you can read all the code very quickly that was so there was like half an hour thing where we made so much progress very quickly

[Participant 6] 07:59:50
Oh, that was nice. And then everything stopped and there was just frustration

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 07:59:58
Any other positive reflections?

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:00:02
I think Felix is…

[Participant 2] 08:00:02
Yeah, so the fast summary aspect I very much like also in terms of not just the paper But the code itself, when we asked what are the steps in the code, it could summarize that very fast. So I think for aggregating.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:00:04
Go ahead.

[Participant 2] 08:00:19
Large amount of data. It's a very useful tool where i just want to drop for your previous question.

[Participant 2] 08:00:29
The issue is with trust, right? So you assume that chat GPT will give you the whole picture if you ask for it.

[Participant 2] 08:00:38
What slowed us down massively was trusting ChatGPT. So we said, read the paper.

[Participant 2] 08:00:45
Give us the exact steps that have been done. And it says very boldly, yes, I know about all these fancy steps. Here's the list. And we trusted a chat gpt and we didn't go into detail ourselves that much we relied

[Participant 2] 08:01:01
On the AI too much and didn't double check everything. So I think that was the the issue. So, you know, the issue is also The flip side of the coin of summarizing everything very well. It is very convenient for summarizing stuff but then there is this 5% that it drops which is so very crucial so

[Participant 2] 08:01:25
That's the main pain point arising from the benefit of it.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:01:31
Thank you. Okay, as promised, we're going to make sure that everybody can answer the next question because it is a very broad question, not just about AI.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:01:40
I really want to understand how your teams divided up the work.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:01:44
And I'll ask the human team, so to be a sort of Jacapo to go in first since you've not chatted for a while.

[Participant 4] 08:01:52
Thanks. Right. So we were two.

[Participant 4] 08:01:57
That's the first piece. We were supposed to be three. We're going to wait for the third.

[Participant 4] 08:02:04
Although we've raised this able to raise this

[Participant 4] 08:02:10
We said. So we basically went quickly through the instructions.

[Participant 4] 08:02:19
Together. Then we said.

[Participant 4] 08:02:23
Let's do this on our own.

[Participant 4] 08:02:28
But when we find a mistake we put it in the chat so that the other one knows.

[Participant 4] 08:02:40
And we basically get to their production faster. We aimed to reproduce as fast as possible and we did in 39 minutes which it seemed to be on the lower end of the distribution.

[Participant 4] 08:02:57
My approach has not been to reproduce the paper.

[Participant 4] 08:03:03
I rather went I'm not sure whether it can be called brute force or went on a sort of a trial. I said, okay, let's try first to just get to the resolved. If I don't manage I'll do the whole thing. And at some point I will get into the result.

[Participant 4] 08:03:24
Never had to get through the whole paper reproduction. Because… after changing the

[Participant 4] 08:03:37
Many paths that were wrong, even internal paths. Um… we found that table that needed to be reproduced we realized that we didn't need to change all of the code in the data cleaning file we went to the analysis file before we finished cleaning or

[Participant 4] 08:03:57
Fixing the mistakes in the data one because we realized in the analysis one it was not using all of the all of the data

[Participant 4] 08:04:09
So yeah, basically I finished replicating My colleague had an issue with one of the comments.

[Participant 4] 08:04:21
That was in the code. Which we noted in the coding arrows. And then we had the robustness checks we took one robustness check each.

[Participant 4] 08:04:35
We did it. We reported it in a file We had a shared Excel file like on a drive. I don't remember which drive it was.

[Participant 4] 08:04:45
I think it was from my colleague. And that was the end of it. By 10 a.m, we were done and dusted.

[Participant 4] 08:04:54
Or 10, all five. I have opened the file that we sent. So there's all the timestamps. That's how I know.

[Participant 4] 08:05:05
It's interesting because now that after the discussion I feel like i when i came in, I thought 100% the cyber people are going to be faster than us But then afterwards, I thought.

[Participant 4] 08:05:20
Probably not because people trust that judge they might go in a cyber team doesn't necessarily need to use ChatGPT. But if I was in a cyber team, I would have gone in thinking, I'm going to use it.

[Participant 4] 08:05:33
And… I was really much faster by myself in 25 minutes we were we had reproduced.

[Participant 4] 08:05:45
You know do i actually need it? I wouldn't have known that I didn't need ChatGPT. Let's put it this way, if I was in a cyber team.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:05:56
And to BS, you're also owner. Thank you for that um You were also on a human-only team. Can I get your reflections on how your team divided up the work?

[Participant 4] 08:05:56
Yeah.

[Participant 4] 08:06:06
Divided i'm sorry.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:06:08
I can come back to you.

[Participant 7] 08:06:24
We started working with those tables and figures, so that was our approach. And then.

[Participant 7] 08:06:26
As soon as we had, we're able to replicate kind of like all the tables and and and and the figures.

[Participant 7] 08:06:32
Then we divided up to work, and kind of like, made sure the numbers are are the same, and if not. What's the reason behind it? And I think.

[Participant 7] 08:06:42
Their Chat. Gpt. Could have helped us. So we say, okay, that's the first table. It's the second table. Just tell us, what is there a difference.

[Participant 7] 08:06:50
So now we kind of like manually checked all the numbers. And then, yeah, we came up with a with a few.

[Participant 7] 08:06:58
Um errors, and also mistakes, or like inconsistencies which were kind of like probably kind of like only minor issues in terms of.

[Participant 7] 08:07:09
Formatting or or decimal decimals, etc., so. Yeah, and at the end we kind of like every one of us thought about two robustness checks, and then we went with the with the best or the.

[Participant 7] 08:07:22
Let's say that the most important ones and.

[Participant 7] 08:07:27
That was it basically. And we also work quite fast. I think after. So we thought. Ah.

[Participant 7] 08:07:31
Let's keep thinking for another half an hour, and so to kind of like whether we can improve something.

[Participant 7] 08:07:38
But at the end of the day, yes, we were quite fast. And yeah.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:07:43
And was there a leader per se on the team?

[Participant 7] 08:07:44
And that was our approach.

[Participant 7] 08:07:48
At the beginning. No, but then the one who was able to was the fastest to replicate the entire file.

[Participant 7] 08:07:54
Probably was leading through the process, or at least was, was kind of like sending out the tables, and so it, kind of like the leader, emerged kind of like.

[Participant 7] 08:08:05
Yeah, just just naturally, in terms of like who was kind of like the had his hands on on the file. Then.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:08:12
Okay. Did you want to add something there, Jacapo

[Participant 4] 08:08:17
Was pretty much the same for us. There wasn't a lead, but then I was the one who reproduced the file so then then I was the one sending the Excel file. I sent the print screen with the result.

[Participant 4] 08:08:32
To show the timestamp to record the timestamp so i've soda became the lead in some sense And I find it interesting that you guys have reproduced the entire paper and have done two robustness check each. We just we were just like, let's finish this in the shortest amount of time.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:08:39
Yeah.

[Participant 4] 08:08:51
And so we didn't care about reproducing the paper. We didn't care about reproducing anything more than the two robustness check that were asked.

[Participant 4] 08:08:59
That's it. But yeah. I think we had a different approach.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:09:04
Then question to both machine and cyborg teams. How did your teams um organize the work was a leader.

[Participant 5] 08:09:18
Yeah, at the beginning, we agreed that I will share my screen.

[Participant 5] 08:09:24
And also type in the prompts. But we always discussed which prompts we are sending out and um yeah and then we also trying to use chat gpt python function After that failed, we decided that we also run the code on my

[Participant 5] 08:09:47
Computer on stator. And so I probably… In some cases formulated the prompts first and then ask them if that's okay.

[Participant 5] 08:10:01
But yeah, pretty much a teamwork overall, I would say.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:10:06
Okay. Any one to add in there?

[Participant 6] 08:10:10
Yeah, so for us, it was three people. It was on Zoom.

[Participant 6] 08:10:15
We didn't really share the work so someone was sharing the screen at all time and we were like just chatting and then that person will prompt it And we're sharing the screen to change because we had like some issues with chat gpt crashing all the time

[Participant 6] 08:10:27
So I will be doing it and my chat gpt will crash So then someone else will share their screen and do that.

[Participant 6] 08:10:36
And in the team it was me and the lasting professor and a PhD student. And so the phd student digital excel files and all these all those things and then send it to other Yeah, I don't think there was a leader and we didn't

[Participant 6] 08:10:50
We always work most of the time it was just working on the same screen and just talking.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:10:59
Okay. Anyone else want to add in there?

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:11:02
Go ahead, Felix.

[Participant 2] 08:11:03
Yeah, it was different because we were meeting in person So the two of us, we were infected that that was And as I earlier mentioned, we basically did our own separate things because i was used to writing everything in Stata

[Participant 2] 08:11:23
And she was doing everything in Python. So we separately tried And actually, I do remember we did a step after step approval, step-by-step approach. We had to replicate I think the fourth like some some data like fourth line in a table or something, fourth column and they build

[Participant 2] 08:11:46
Up on each other. So come one, two, three, they all build up on each other and four was including some other error corrections or something And so we tried to replicate the first come, then the second, then the third, then the fourth.

[Participant 2] 08:12:01
To understand why after we failed in replicating number four first, because we thought by figuring like when we're replicated the first column we know that for this until this point everything is is correct Second one, everything is correct. And if you fail to replicate the third column, then the error must be there, basically. So we did that.

[Participant 2] 08:12:27
But she tried to do it in Python. I tried to do it in Stata.

[Participant 2] 08:12:31
We didn't have a shared language there, unfortunately. And so she also used her own chat GPT. I used my own chat GPT conversations. But we often updated each other. Usually.

[Participant 2] 08:12:46
Came a little bit faster. And so I told her what I found and what she might use to adjust her own progress, basically.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:12:54
I see.

[Participant 2] 08:12:55
So we didn't really have a leader because everyone cooked their own soup.

[Participant 2] 08:13:00
That's, yeah.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:13:03
Great. A question to cyborg and AI teams. Do you think that the AI shaped your collaboration?

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:13:12
The way that your team worked.

[Participant 3] 08:13:15
It absolutely influenced stars only because it required a completely different division of labor midway through the task.

[Participant 3] 08:13:23
So the way we started was that I lab booked to try and figure out the exact times that errors happen. So I was trying to get a really precise read on that. And then the other two researchers in my team each independently tried to reproduce the package as quickly as possible.

[Participant 3] 08:13:42
One realized that one realized a few hours in He was getting nowhere with trying to use the initial terminal So that's when the decision was made to switch that terminal to one that would start trying to process the code in Python. And that was the one that actually gave us outputs that we could try and use.

[Participant 3] 08:14:02
Eventually, but that basically meant that the inability of the LLM to produce outputs for us early on forced a division of labor further down the line as one decided to splinter off into a task that ultimately ended up being the one that got us closest to reproducing anything.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:14:23
I see. Thank you. Anyone else want to add in there?

[Participant 6] 08:14:29
Yeah, I think if I was not in the machine team would probably have shared the work and it's mostly I don't think there was much to share, right?

[Participant 6] 08:14:40
He was mostly trying to make ChatGPT work and none of us could make it work. So we're just like We're all stuck at the same point.

[Participant 6] 08:14:50
I don't know we could share so So we just like, yeah.

[Participant 6] 08:14:55
We're all stuck at the same point and we so there wasn't never really a way to really share share the work

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:15:02
I see. Any other reflections there?

[Participant 5] 08:15:11
I mean, as I said. Did everything on one computer but we probably could also mate.

[Participant 5] 08:15:20
Another choice that each of each group member does it on its own but we decided from the beginning I don't know if that's then related that we were an AI-led team That's probably yes.

[Participant 5] 08:15:36
Because we wanted to have one chat where everything is documented.

[Participant 5] 08:15:41
And we always discussed or decisions done in a team

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:15:47
David, you looked like you were about to say something. Did you want to jump in?

[Participant 1] 08:15:54
Not necessarily, but I can. Our team Well, we met, we were just two people so we met and we discussed the task and then we He stayed in the call, but we worked separately and then we just told each other when we were done with what we agreed to do

[Participant 1] 08:16:12
Let me discuss again. And the same with and without shared repet so i think in that respect, chat GPT GTP did not.

[Participant 1] 08:16:21
Affect the way we work as a team. But that's due to the very shaper work.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:16:27
Okay. Okay, thank you.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:16:32
You were to do the games again, would you use AI differently?

[Participant 6] 08:16:46
I don't think I will use differently but i think chat gpt is much better now.

[Participant 6] 08:16:49
So I think I will… So I think I will do the same thing maybe since we've worked better because ChatGPT is able to do more stuff i find uh they used to.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:17:04
Okay. Would anybody do anything different ways to do it all over again?

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:17:13
And we go to AI.

[Participant 3] 08:17:14
I perhaps start in Python. Perhaps… I might only do this with R because with Stata, this is virtually impossible because R and Python are both object oriented and state is not object oriented in that sense.

[Participant 3] 08:17:31
But I think that if I were working with R, I would start with Python again, just because I know ChatGPT has more training with it, as do all LLMs.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:17:42
So you think it would depend on the coding language that you were assigned to?

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:17:47
The strategy that you take. Anyone else want to share their thoughts there?

[Participant 3] 08:17:48
I think so.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:17:57
Yes, go ahead, Felix.

[Participant 2] 08:17:59
Yeah, so I would probably just feed it the complete data set from the very start.

[Participant 2] 08:18:06
Give it more context, more meat to bite on.

[Participant 2] 08:18:12
Yeah.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:18:14
Thanks. Okay, a big question now. What do you think explains the differences in performance between the AI-led, AI-assisted and human-only teams? And of course, this is open to everybody.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:18:30
I can, yes. What do you think explains the differences in performance between the AI-led AI-assisted and human-only teams.

[Participant 1] 08:18:44
Can you remind us what exactly the

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:18:50
Yes, so absolutely. The AI-led was what we've been referring to as machine.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:18:56
Ai-assisted would be cyborg and human only as humans only. And the difference is in performance, sorry, that was your question.

[Participant 4] 08:19:03
I…

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:19:06
Yes. So overall, we found that the human only teams were slightly better.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:19:15
At reproducibility and replicability. And the machine teams were not so great and the cyborg were in the middle.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:19:25
One more context on that. I'm happy to provide it. So basically, what we found in the paper was there's a very stark difference between machine teams And the rest of them.

[Participant 4] 08:19:26
Oh.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:19:27
Please. Yeah.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:19:39
Across all categories, not only reproducibility rates, but also error findings And so on and so on.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:19:47
And there's basically very, very small differences between cyborgs and humans. The only uh mark difference comes with reproduced immunity rates.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:20:00
The time to reproduction, it took cyborgs slightly short times to get there.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:20:10
But humans were much better at finding errors compared to to cybers so it's a it's a bit of a of a nuanced finding in the sense that Although cyborgs are faster, they seem to find less errors than humans.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:20:28
So we were wondering if your experience in the EA games gives you any light on why sheds any light on why this might be happening.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:20:40
Like, why is this the case?

[Participant 2] 08:20:45
I think it shows that if you have to really dig dig into the paper right and think a lot It takes time, but it also pays out.

[Participant 2] 08:20:57
Ai gives us a quick fix, right? It gives us quick response that we are can be easily satisfied with it's good enough. It comes without much trouble and much effort and we can just close our books and go home early. But that's not how excellence is produced. Excellence is produced by

[Participant 2] 08:21:22
Really jumping in there, spending some time with the content And not relying on quick fixes.

[Participant 2] 08:21:30
I think that might be the main purpose. Well, not purpose explanation.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:21:37
Thank you. Jacapo, you've got your hand up.

[Participant 4] 08:21:39
Yeah, I wanted to come in because I'm not sure just on the intro from Pablo I do remember that And I'm seeing the paper, the minutes to reproduction is lower in the human only, not in the AI-assisted.

[Participant 4] 08:21:55
So a little, I think you said the opposite

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:21:57
It's when you look at the, yes, you're correct. When you look at the average, yes. But when you look at the whole distribution.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:22:05
It seems like And you can correct me and look at the paper. It seems like the peak, the average time in which the whole, sorry, I'll rephrase this stuff to be as factually correct as possible. So the whole distribution for the

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:22:23
For the cyborg team seems to be towards the left compared to the humans.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:22:29
What we see is that there's a lingering tale that persists for cyberth.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:22:37
Which could be the could be the case because there's people who keep iterating and try to use AI to find solutions to this stuff.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:22:50
But on its own, it's quite interesting. And I wanted to hear from you what you wanted to hear from you what you think about

[Participant 4] 08:23:02
I'll probably repeat myself in what I said before. I think people in the cyborg team felt Or if I was in the cyborg team, I would have felt compelled to use it.

[Participant 4] 08:23:17
And at least for the minutes to reproduction, I think we should go a bit more specific. In general, it seems that AI is not so good at doing some things.

[Participant 4] 08:23:26
A number of things, very simply put. And then we probably have to think also through the specific tasks for the minutes to reproduction.

[Participant 4] 08:23:41
As I said, I think if I was in a cyber team, I would have gone straight to AI.

[Participant 4] 08:23:47
Without thinking, oh, I will be faster myself because the expectation I would come in would be I'll be faster with it.

[Participant 4] 08:23:55
This will be faster than me. So why should I try to do it myself Why should I try to do it myself? I will throw it to the AI, but then that takes time.

[Participant 4] 08:24:07
And that resulted into the larger minister production. Although it wasn't, I'm just checking again the results, it wasn't significant So it was very similar. So the average was was very similar lengthier and they take they took more time but it wasn't really significant and probably that's a result of that

[Participant 4] 08:24:26
Distribution that you were mentioning.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:24:28
I think one of the sorry sorry

[Participant 4] 08:24:31
No, no, that was it. So I think it's a matter of the expectation of if I'm in the cyborg team.

[Participant 4] 08:24:36
Then AI would be better and then I would do that.

[Participant 4] 08:24:39
But if one thought probably now, now, I haven't been in the human team Even if I was in the cyber team, I would probably go straight into doing it myself without AI.

[Participant 4] 08:24:55
And then when I need it and when I think I need it, I would resort to In some sense. I'm not sure whether this is making sense.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:25:04
I think it does.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:25:05
It does.

[Participant 3] 08:25:07
A question about, it's both a question and perhaps an explanation.

[Participant 3] 08:25:13
One thing is that by giving a chat GPT an entire replication package, you're giving it something where it has to read a lot of information all at once, not just having to read a data frame that contains all of the different

[Participant 3] 08:25:27
All the different numbers and all the different text strings involved inside.

[Participant 3] 08:25:31
But if you think about it, then the way it's reading that information is it's tokenizing everything.

[Participant 3] 08:25:36
Right. And I know that in the most recent 4-0 model, that's not the most recent, but that's the most recent one that there's public limitation for.

[Participant 3] 08:25:44
4.0, they have this token limit of like 128,000 tokens And part of what I wonder is When you feed it a replication package, how close to those token limits do you actually get?

[Participant 3] 08:25:58
In the sense that like, is ChatGPT only looking at a subset of that information because it by rule cannot process that much information at once.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:26:14
I can answer that. The way it works is, if that's what you're asking, the way it works it starts reading and tokenizing stuff up until the limit So we've reached that limit.

[Participant 4] 08:26:15
I think this is great.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:26:30
It immediately cuts off and it's as if the rest of the information that you're giving it it's not existent.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:26:37
So… That's… if that helps to get some context.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:26:45
Does anybody else want to share their thoughts on this question?

[Participant 6] 08:26:50
Yeah, so to explain the relative one was obvious that the machines are doing very poorly For me, that's obvious because you need some human to be there that the cyborg didn't find the error?

[Participant 6] 08:27:07
I think that's not that surprising because you rely on the AI so you don't go into the details as what felix just said that you don't read the paper you get a summary you don't get you don't read the

[Participant 6] 08:27:21
The code or like the code that you get is you didn't write it yourself so you know there might be a mistake or no you don't really understand all of it. So I think the fact like the tiny details or the mistake which are not obvious

[Participant 6] 08:27:39
I can see that if you rely on the AI, you're going to miss it.

[Participant 6] 08:27:46
But I would expect that if you're in a cyborg tick and there's an obvious mistake you will still find it with your human eyes.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:27:55
Yeah. Okay. Thank you so much, everybody. I realize that we are coming towards the end of the session. So I do just want to give a chance for everybody to just share any any last thoughts that you have about your experience, your team's interaction or anything at all that you think we should know?

[Participant 5] 08:28:12
Yeah, maybe to the very last question, one quick comment for us.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:28:17
Please.

[Participant 5] 08:28:18
I think the… So the difference in the difference computational reproducibility achieved by the machine teams versus the other two teams.

[Participant 5] 08:28:30
We had… tremendous trouble that ChatGPT wasn't really good in combining information from the paper from the README file and from the do file.

[Participant 5] 08:28:41
So it's… at large problems which humans and cyborgs could easily resolve by combining information maybe that's related to the token limit problem. But yeah, I don't know and with the errors detection i think that might also be related to the token limit in orth felix

[Participant 5] 08:29:03
Set it that ChatGPT is too and to try to please If you insert something Which JetGPT assumes it's from from the uh user And then says it's good as it is.

[Participant 5] 08:29:21
Especially if it's a large amount of information.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:29:25
Thank you. Any other final thoughts?

[Participant 1] 08:29:31
I was wondering if, I don't know, I think it's not mentioned in the paper or maybe I missed it, if there was any difference between those themes that worked on the R and the Stata package.

[Participant 1] 08:29:43
Or maybe there is a difference because I would also assume that ChatGPT could be better at tackling the R code.

[Participant 1] 08:29:53
Because I think it's really horrendously bad. I don't use R myself, but I use Stata and Python Somebody said it before, it's really really good at powerful and can do essentially anything in this data sometimes stumbles upon the most simple things that

[Participant 1] 08:30:09
Anybody with a PhD knows.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:30:19
Yeah, a good point. Any last thoughts?

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:30:25
Nope. Okay, I'm going to wrap up the session then. And just to say again.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:30:30
Thank you all so, so much for your time. It's been really an enlightening session. I've enjoyed it a lot.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:30:35
And I hope that you've got something out of it too.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:30:39
We, of course, will stay in touch in terms of what comes out of these qualitative studies and Let's see where the future of this paper goes. Thank you all so much.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:30:56
Thank you so, so much.

[Participant 6] 08:30:56
Thank you. Bye.

[Participant 4] 08:30:56
Thank you. Bye-bye.

[Rachel Joy Forshaw] 08:30:58
I know. Can I stay on with you, Juan Pablo, for five minutes?

[Participant 2] 08:30:59
Bye-bye.

[Juan Pablo Posada Aparicio] 08:31:03
Of course.
